    "Inheritance is a feature of Object Oriented Programming. It is used to specify that one class will get most or all of its features from its parent class. It is a very powerful feature which facilitates users to create a new class with a few or more modification to an existing class. The new class is called child class or derived class and the main class from which it inherits the properties is called base class or parent class.\n",
